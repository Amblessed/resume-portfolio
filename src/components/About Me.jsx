    About Me
  </h2>
  <div class="space-y-6 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed text-lg">
    <p>
      I’m a <span class="font-semibold text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400">Certified Test Automation Engineer</span> and 
      <span class="font-semibold text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400"> Professional Scrum Master</span> with experience designing scalable test automation 
      frameworks and backend systems. My expertise spans  
      <span class="font-semibold text-indigo-600 dark:text-indigo-400"> Java, Spring Boot, Python, Cucumber, Jenkins, and SQL</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="italic text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">Africa’s development is often hindered not by lack of talent or compassion, but by the absence of reliable data. </span> 
      Too many decisions are made in the dark—without records, without visibility, without justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      This challenge led me to <span class="font-semibold text-green-600 dark:text-green-400">Backend Engineering</span>. 
      With 7 years in test automation and a growing focus on data-related topics, I now design systems that 
      <span class="underline decoration-yellow-400"> capture truth and preserve dignity</span>. 
      My current mission: to build a sponsorship portal that ensures every child’s story is recorded, every donation is traceable, and every sponsor can give with clarity and trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe backend systems can do more than store data—they can 
      <span class="font-semibold text-purple-600 dark:text-purple-400"> restore visibility</span>, 
      <span class="font-semibold text-purple-600 dark:text-purple-400">empower communities</span>, and 
      <span class="font-semibold text-purple-600 dark:text-purple-400"> build legacies of integrity</span>.
